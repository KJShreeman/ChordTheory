# ChordTheory
ChordTheory helps you figure out the chords and notes in any major or minor scale, and create a song with the chord progressions you need!

## Option 1
You can input 1 to figure out the key of a song based on chords, or the notes you input. You may create a song after that.

## Option 2
You can input 2 to create a song immediately, based on any major or minor scale you want. You will have options to see the chords, notes and even switch the scale anytime!

## Have fun!
